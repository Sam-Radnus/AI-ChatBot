## DEMO

## Description

This project showcases a web application built using React and Django that communicates with a deployed Language Model (LLM) through WebSockets. The web app provides a user interface for users to interact with the LLM in real-time, sending input data and receiving model-generated responses through the power of WebSockets.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how to integrate a dynamic frontend framework (React) with a robust backend framework (Django) and leverage WebSockets for efficient and low-latency communication with a deployed LLM.

## Features

- Real-time interaction with the Language Model through WebSockets.
- Seamless integration of React for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- Utilization of Django for managing server-side logic and communication.
- Clear documentation and setup instructions to help users understand and utilize the application.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React 
- Backend: Django , Django Rest Framework


## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   cd project-repo
2. Install frontend dependencies and build the React app:
```
cd project
npm install
npm run build
```
3. Install backend dependencies:

```
cd server
```
4. Run the Django development server:
